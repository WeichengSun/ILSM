Description: 
    In view of the analysis of the structural characteristics of the tripartite 
    network has been complete, however, there is still a lack of a unified 
    operation that can quickly obtain the corresponding characteristics of the 
    tripartite network. 
    To solve this insufficiency, 'ILSM' was designed for supporting calculating 
    such metrics of tripartite networks by functions of this R package.
